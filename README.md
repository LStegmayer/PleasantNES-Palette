# PleasantNESs-Palette
An NES palette designed for aesthetic appeal rather than authenticity.

[See here](https://lstegmayer.github.io/Luke-Stegmayer/Articles/NES%20Palette/NES_palette.html) for more information and comparisons.  You only need the .pal file.

This palette is version 0.1 and hosted on Github as I may make minor changes in the future.  If you have a suggestion for changing certain colors, you are welcome to file an issue or pull request.
